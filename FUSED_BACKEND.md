# RWKV-7 HF Fused Backend Goal

This phase tracks the performance work that turns the existing HF-compatible
RWKV-7 adapter into a fused native backend while keeping the public entrypoints
inside the HF wrapper.

## Scope

The fused backend is not a separate inference engine. It must be reachable from
standard HF-facing paths:

- `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(..., trust_remote_code=True)`
- `model.generate(..., use_cache=True)`
- `model.rwkv7_forward_token(...)`
- `RWKV7StateCache` dynamic-batch and chunked-prefill helpers

The current wrapper/native split remains intact:

- HF wrapper owns compatibility with Transformers, PEFT, Trainer, TRL, cache
  semantics, quantization loading, and benchmark/report gates.
- `native_jit` / `native_graph` / future fused kernels are performance backends
  selected by runtime dispatch.
- `native_model` remains experimental until it reaches the same compatibility
  and benchmark surface.

## Albatross target ladder

Current committed V100 0.1B evidence shows HF native-graph decode at roughly
`0.32x`-`0.47x` Albatross and B=1,T=512 prefill at roughly `0.316x` Albatross.
The staged target is:

| Stage | Decode target | Prefill target | Meaning |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| P1 | `>=0.55x` Albatross | `>=0.60x` Albatross | fused backend is clearly working |
| P2 | `>=0.75x` Albatross | `>=0.80x` Albatross | close enough for serious bounty review |
| P3 | `>=0.90x` Albatross | follow measured bottlenecks | near-Albatross HF path |

The analyzer reports this under `fused_backend_targets` so progress is visible
from `bench/results.jsonl` instead of living only in notes.

## Quantized backend targets

Generic bitsandbytes remains a compatibility baseline, not the final fast path.
Production quantized inference needs RWKV-native packing and fused dequant GEMV:

| Mode | Footprint target | Speed target |
|---|---:|---:|
| W8 | `<=0.75x` fp16 footprint | decode `>=1.0x` fp16 reference |
| W4 | `<=0.55x` fp16 footprint | decode `>=1.0x` fp16 reference |

V100 is the first regression baseline. Newer Ada/Blackwell-class cards should be
used to validate that W8/W4 can eventually approach or beat fp16 native-graph
serving speed.

## Planned PR sequence

1. Fused-backend target/reporting gate.
2. Matrix-level projection/LoRA profiler and candidate shapes.
   - `bench/bench_projection_lora.py` emits `sample_matrix_profile`,
     `sample_matrix_profile_summary`, and `fused_kernel_plan`.
   - `bench/analyze_results.py` surfaces the first fused fp16 target in
     `projection_lora` and `next_focus`.
3. Fused fp16 projection prototype.
4. Native-graph integration for the fused projection path.
5. Fused recurrent state update.
6. Native W8 pack plus fused int8 dequant-GEMV.
7. Native W4 pack plus fused int4 dequant-GEMV.
8. V100 + 5070/newer-GPU benchmark matrix.

## Backend dispatch requirement

Fast paths must be optional and hardware-aware:

```text
if native fused quant CUDA is available and supported:
    native_quant_cuda
elif fused fp16 CUDA/Triton is available and supported:
    native_fused_fp16
elif native_graph is available:
    native_graph
elif native_jit is available:
    native_jit
else:
    FLA / PyTorch fallback
```

The project can claim broad hardware support only through this fallback stack.
It must not claim the same peak speed on every GPU generation.
